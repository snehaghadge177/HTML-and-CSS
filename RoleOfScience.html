    <h2>Agriculture</h2>
    <p>In the field of agriculture, science has made its mark by contributing so much. 
        In present days machines are available even for sowing the seeds on fields. Tractor, thresher, drip irrigation system,
         sprinkler irrigation system, etc., all are given by science. All fertilizers are also given by chemical science.

    <h2>Medicine</h2>
    <p>The medical field is based entirely on the usage of science. All the drugs are given by medicinal chemistry. 
        Tools used in the medical field are also given by science. Machines such as stretchers, the ECG machine,
         MRI machines and even injections were invented by science.

    <h2>Transportation</h2>
    <p>All vehicles are the invention of science. Science has made the world a small place. You can reach Kashmir to
         Kanyakumari in just a few hours. Cycle, scooters, cars, aircraft, etc., all are inventions of science. 
         We can transport goods easily and faster by the use of machines given by science.

    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <p>Science has made the world very small. You can talk to anyone anywhere in a fraction of seconds.
         Telephones, mobile phones, etc., all are the inventions of science. All these mediums of communications are available
          at a very low cost as well. So, all are within reach of the common man. Science has made it very easy and cheap to talk
           to someone using a mobile phone.

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p>Science is the base of all buildings constructed by us. The construction of buildings is completed based on the technology 
        given by science. Machines used in the construction work such as motor graders, bulldozers, backhoe loaders, etc.
         given by science.
